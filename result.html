        <ol>
            <li><p>5G mobile networks DO NOT spread COVID-19.</p></li>
            <li><p>Exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25C degrees DOES NOT prevent the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).</p></li>
            <li><p>You can recover from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Catching the new coronavirus DOES NOT mean you will have it for life.</p></li>
            <li><p>Being able to hold your breath for 10 seconds or more without coughing or feeling discomfort DOES NOT mean you are free from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) or any other lung disease.</p></li>
            <li><p>Drinking alcohol does not protect you against COVID-19 and can be dangerous.</p></li>
            <li><p>OVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates.</p></li>
